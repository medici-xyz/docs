# Allow Lists

The initial distribution of NFTs in your community can often determine its fate. In order to avoid a bad distribution you want to make sure that you reward contributors and active members! This can easily be done using an allow list. Medici's [launch tool](https://launch.medicilabs.xyz/) has an option upon project creation to accept an allow list, as well as to the option to trigger a claim period separately of the minting period.
