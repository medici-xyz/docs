# ✨ Overview ✨

We believe NFTs are ✨magic✨. They're capable of turning the tenuous strands of the internet into value creating communities, but we're not the first to proclaim this.

And we wont be the last. 


## What Makes Us Different

We have two main focuses:

1. NFTs should be ✨fun✨ - which means
2. Your **launch** should be optimized - Sometimes smart contract optimization comes at the cost of UX. For exmaple, even though it costs slightly more gas, utilizing standards like ERC721R creates a much better experience for your community.



## What do we offer ** now **


You bring the media, we'll set you up with contracts and a custom minting site.



## Other Fun Things Were Thinking About

* Programmable community fees
* Off chain nft auction engine

The problem with clearing NFTs on EVM based chains is that they are inherently tied the fall back first price auction that is tipping in ethereum 1559 mechanism. While roll ups will allow us to increase our total throughout, our burst capacity does not scale as much, and demand will most likely grow to fill this gap.
